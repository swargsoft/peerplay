# [PeerPlay](https://github.com/freeman-jiang/pearplay) P2P Fork

Ephemeral Synchronized multi-device audio playback in the browser — now 100% **p2p** using [Trystero](https://github.com/dmotz/trystero).

> Create a room, upload tracks and play in sync. No backend, no cloud storage, no audio leaks.

## Live demo

**[https://audiohacking.github.io/pearplay-p2p](https://audiohacking.github.io/pearplay-p2p)**

Open the link, join or create a 6-digit room, and share the URL with others in the same session.

> Demo is hosted on github pages without any backend

### Use Cases

- Party Mode: Sync all your machines to play in perfect sync all over the place
- Play Mode: Share and play your demos/mixes safely while chatting _(audio/text)_
- Your Mode: Just do whatever you want with it, in perfect sync.

## Why P2P?

This fork is built around a **serverless** room model:

- **Your audio stays on your devices.** Uploads are stored in the browser (IndexedDB) and sent **directly to peers** over WebRTC. Unlike the original Beatsync, files are **never uploaded to a central server**, so there is no server-side copy that could be retained, scanned, or leaked.
- **No account or backend room host.** Peers coordinate playback, queue, chat, and clock sync among themselves. Signaling uses public WebRTC relays only to establish connections — not to host your music.
- **Same sync goals as the original.** Scheduled play/pause, NTP-style clock alignment, spatial audio, and queue controls — without tying playback to a single datacenter.

Trade-offs: you need at least one peer online who has a given track for others to fetch it.

## Quickstart (local dev)

```bash
bun install
bun dev    # http://localhost:3000
```

Upload audio from the queue panel. Files stay local and replicate to other peers in the room when they connect.

## How it works

| Piece             | Role                                                  |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `apps/client`     | Next.js app — UI, Trystero rooms, per-peer room state |
| `packages/shared` | Zod schemas for room messages and P2P envelopes       |

- **Room id:** `pearplay-p2p-v1-{6-digit-code}` (Trystero)
- **Track ids:** `p2p://{trackId}` — blobs in IndexedDB, transferred via Trystero `audio-track` actions
- **Sync:** NTP-style probes between peers; play/pause scheduled against a shared clock
